# Villa Prescilla Resort — Digital Contract Builder (PWA)

A mobile-first, offline-first Progressive Web App designed to bring Villa Prescilla Resort’s contract workflow into the modern era. No more messy handwriting, lost papers, or frantic “Where did we file that?” moments. This tool helps administrators create, manage, and version contracts with confidence and speed.

## 🌐 Project Overview

### Description
This system streamlines the resort’s booking workflow by enabling admins to digitally produce and store client contracts. It offers a clean UI, predictable flow, and built-in version control — ensuring accuracy and integrity across all booking transactions.

### The Problem
- Rate changes lead to corrections and erasures on paper contracts.
- Physical copies get passed around, misplaced, or delayed in filing.

### The Solution
- Provide a frictionless way to draft and update contracts without messy manual edits.
- Eliminate the risk of losing important documents by storing everything digitally.
- Improve income tracking with consistent, versioned data.

### Primary Audience
- Villa Prescilla Resort administrators

### Success Criteria
- Contracts can be created in just a few minutes.
- Any modification (amenity removal, supplier addition, discounts, etc.) is captured as a new version.
- Older versions remain accessible and organized without clutter.
